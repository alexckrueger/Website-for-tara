									<h2>About Tara Duggal</h2>
									<p>Tara Duggal was born in Hinsdale, Illinois. In 2022, she will receive her Bachelor of Arts in Drawing, Painting, and Printmaking from Loyola University Chicago. Duggal has been included in the Student Juried Exhibition at the Ralph Arnold Gallery in Chicago, Illinois. She will also be included in Extra Lemonade at the Ralph Arnold Gallery. Duggal works in a variety of media such as paint and fibers, including embroidery thread and yarn.</p>
									<p>"As an artist, I focus on the hidden aspects of life and how people live in privacy. I believe that secrecy is an innate part of the human experience and all people have aspects of their lives that they do not share with others. Through my work, I aim to explore the hidden and private aspects of my life as well as make them more visible to others."</p>
									<p>"I use a variety of mediums, such as embroidery thread and yarn, to mimic the delicate balance that is private and public life. When working with thread, there is often a front that is visible to others and a back side that is concealed. When others view my art, I aspire to have them ponder what properties from their own life they conceal from others. With each piece of art I make I seek to delve deeper into what it means to be a private person in a public world."</p>
